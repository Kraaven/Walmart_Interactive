Walmart Sparkathon was an India Wide Hackathon that requested students to try building something that would benefit the retail industry. Hence bore fruit: Walmart Interactive.


## What The Project Is

This Project is all about clients with a VR headset accessing a catalog, each with an archive of products represented as 3D models via modeling or NERF 3D model reconstruction methods. 

We as a team, created a system, to register products, with a backend maintaining a database and a pipeline to generate a 3D model, to then be available and viewed on the VR Client.

## What I did?

I was responsible for the entire VR client. I learned a lot about WebRequests, And parsing json for required data. 

Worked with GLTF's so the entire pipeline allowed easy download and creation of GameObjects for the User to view. I also included some nice UI that makes viewing the model a _lot more sense_.

Personal Note: Start from **2:34** in the above video to skip to the VR Part :D
